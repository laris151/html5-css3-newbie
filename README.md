# html5-css3-newbie
My first website using HTML5 and CSS3 (newbie)
Well, let me first talk a little about me...

I've graduated in Advertising and Marketing, and I'm working now with Digital Solutions, Special in Business Intelligence.

My boyfriend is a Developer Specialist for a lot of years, and talking with him I was pretty curious about how to learn codes, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phyton, etc. Of course, I'm a newbie, so... you can't expect so much about me. lol

It is my first project using HTML5 and CSS3. I used the program "Atom" and read a lot of articles in websites, had my boyfriend's support, watched videos and finally I created an account here =)
