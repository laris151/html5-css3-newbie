# html5-css3-newbie
My first website using HTML5 and CSS3 (newbie)

Well, first let me talk a little about me...
I graduated in Advertising and Marketing, and I'm working now with Digital Solutions, a specialist in Business Intelligence.

My boyfriend has been a Developer Specialist for many years, and whilst talking to him, I was pretty curious about how to code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phyton, etc).
Of course, I'm a newbie, so...you can't expect that much from me. lol

This is my first project using HTML5 and CSS3. I used the program "Atom" and read a lot of articles in websites. I also had my boyfriend's support, watched videos and finally, I created an account here =)
