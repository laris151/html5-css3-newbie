# html5-css3-newbie
My first website using HTML5 and CSS3 (newbie)

Well, first let me talk a little about me...
I'm graduated in Advertising and Marketing and Currently I'm working with Digital Solutions, special in Business Intelligence.

My boyfriend is a Developer Specialist since a lot of years, and talking with him I  was pretty curious about how to learn codes, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Phyton, etc.
Of course, I'm a newbie, so... you can't expect so much about me. lol

This is my first project using HTML5 and CSS3. I used the program "Atom" and read a lot of articles in websites, had my boyfriend's support, watched videos and finaly I created an account here =)
